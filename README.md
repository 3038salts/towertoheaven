# Tower To Heaven
(Mildly similar to [Tower of Heaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Heaven) (天国の塔) by Askiisoft)

# How to run this?
Clone the repository and make sure to use `Python 3.10`. Open up the folder `TP3` and run `main.py`.

# Any external modules?
Nope. (Technically cmu_graphics, but we're assuming we're in the realm of 15-112)

# Storyline
In this game, you start out as a cute cat in a forest. One day, you encounter a
tower and open the door. As you ascend the tower, you will fight ghosts and
avoid spinning blades. You have the mythical ability to shoot bullets. When you
reach the top of the tower, you'll be in heaven!

# Any shortcuts?
I do not endorse cheating, so there aren't any.
